        <h3>Are you making the most of City Link?</h3>
        <p>Here at City Link we have been working hard to modernise and improve the services we offer our customers. This programme of work has included some fundamental changes and improvements to our operations and our IT systems, all of them with customer service in mind.</p>
        <p>Given the amount of change we’ve been making we thought we’d take this opportunity to give you a round-up of everything we’ve been up to and make sure you’re using the easiest and most up to date channels for managing your City Link account.</p>

          <p>We’ve been modernising our operations and back-end processes. We’ve just completed the installation of our new hybrid- automation sorter at our Coventry hub which will enable us to improve efficiency and compliance without compromising our ability to take a varied mix of freight. And we’ve rolled out a smart, new branded uniform for all our drivers.</p>
          <p>To enhance tracking data and overall tracking compliance, we’re also starting to roll-out brand new driver hand-held devices with greatly improved battery life.</p>
          <p>Work continues on automating our claims process and developing a single eBooking and labelling solution for all of our services. We hope to be able to pilot both of these in the New Year.</p>
          <p>All of these changes are being supported by our “City Link Way” project which is focusing on making the most of these innovations and on reviewing processes to provide a consistent and streamlined service. Based on your feedback the focus this autumn is improving collection compliance and the speed and efficiency of issue resolution.</p>
